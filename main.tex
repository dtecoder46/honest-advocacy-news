\section{Code of Conduct}

As the developer of Honest Advocacy News, I do not condone users from forking my repository for use against the poor and marginalized or against minority groups. If I find that a fork breaches this code of conduct, I will ensure that the fork is deleted from GitHub.

\section{How to Access}

\subsection{GitHub Pages}

Find the repository named "honest-advocacy-news". Then navigate to the website link found on the right side and you should be able to access the blog.

\subsection{Chrome extension}

In the repository, navigate to the "chrome" branch. Download every file in that branch, including the manifest.json file. It is important to have this file, otherwise Chrome will reject the extension. Put all of these files in a folder on your computer. Activate the Chrome desktop app or download Chrome if you have not done so. Click "Extensions" (the puzzle piece in the toolbar). Click "Manage Extensions" and then select "Load Unpacked" in the top left corner. Select your folder and click on the gear in the box with the name of the extension. Scroll down and ensure that the extension is pinned to the toolbar. Click on the extension button on the toolbar, and the blog will appear!
